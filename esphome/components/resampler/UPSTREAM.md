# Resampler scheduling for full audio profiles

Based on the ESPHome 2026.8.2 installed component. The C++ files match
ESPHome commit `b9eda644cd0219e560933b5151c0912f4c648278` before this patch.
The Python schema differs from that commit only in type annotations.

This adapter retains the upstream resampling algorithm, buffers and speaker
lifecycle. It exposes `task_core` (0 or 1, unpinned when omitted) and
`task_priority` (1 to 23, default 1). It requires `esp_audio_stack` and reuses
its pinned-task creation primitive, with ESP-IDF stack sizes in bytes.
The same task owns all resampling work and is released only after its stopped
notification, as in the upstream lifecycle.

On dual-core ESP32 chips, floating-point work can pin an unbound task to the
core where it first runs. Full profiles can select a core explicitly to keep
resampling from competing with microphone DSP. These settings do not change
sample rates or add audio buffering.

The upstream C++ files retain their GPLv3 license; the Python schema retains
its MIT license. The original ESPHome license is included in `LICENSE`.
